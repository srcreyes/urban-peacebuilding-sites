# Urban Peacebuilding Sites Observatory

Spatial peacebuilding highlights the agency of places and spaces that promote peace or reinforce conflict in conflict-affected societies. This paper draws on the growing literature on spatial peacebuilding in an urban context to analyze the post-siege reconstruction of Marawi City. In 2017, Marawi City witnessed a five-month battle between Islamic militant groups and the Philippine military, resulting in the longest urban warfare in the country. The aftermath of the siege saw more than a thousand people dead, thousands more injured, and hundreds of thousands became refugees in neighboring provinces. The government has launched an inter-agency reconstruction effort, but the ruins of residential houses, commercial buildings, and places of worship have become fixtures of the new urbanscape of Marawi City. This pre-fieldwork paper explores the potential peace-promoting and conflict-reinforcing agencies of urban spaces and places in the reconstruction of Marawi City. This exploration aims to contribute an urban perspective to spatial peacebuilding scholarship and inform national/subnational policies for rebuilding Marawi City.
